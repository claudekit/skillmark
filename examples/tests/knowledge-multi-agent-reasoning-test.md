# Prompt

How do you design multi-agent systems with context isolation? Explain the key architectural patterns and cost implications.

# Expected

The response should cover:
- [ ] Orchestrator pattern for coordination between agents
- [ ] Consensus mechanisms for collective decisions
- [ ] Cost implications (~15x token multiplier for multi-agent)
- [ ] Context isolation strategies to prevent cross-contamination
- [ ] Message passing or shared memory approaches
- [ ] Error handling and fallback strategies
