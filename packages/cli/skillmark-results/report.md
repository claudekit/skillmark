## Test Results

### ○ basic-context-check

- **Accuracy**: 20.0%
- **Concepts Matched**: usage-limits, usage limits
- **Concepts Missed**: context-monitoring, token-utilization, window percentage, based recommendations, Reports current context window percentage (or explains how to obtain it), Reports 5-hour and 7-day usage limits (or explains data sources), Provides threshold-based recommendations (70% warning, 90% critical), Mentions optimization strategies if usage is elevated

### ○ context-optimization-strategies

- **Accuracy**: 33.3%
- **Concepts Matched**: compaction, bucket strategy, Mentions 50-70% compaction target with <5% quality loss
- **Concepts Missed**: four-bucket-strategy, token-reduction, Explains the four-bucket strategy (Write, Select, Compress, Isolate), Recommends compaction triggers at 70-80% utilization, Suggests sub-agent partitioning for context isolation, Advises placing critical info at beginning/end positions

### ○ context-degradation-debugging

- **Accuracy**: 0.0%
- **Concepts Matched**: None
- **Concepts Missed**: degradation, lost-in-middle, attention-mechanics, debugging, attention curve, Explains U-shaped attention curve (favors beginning/end positions), Identifies "lost-in-middle" phenomenon as the cause, Recommends repositioning critical info to beginning or end, Suggests context compression or chunking strategies, May reference degradation reference documentation

### ○ test-context-optimization-strategy

- **Accuracy**: 10.0%
- **Concepts Matched**: bucket strategy
- **Concepts Missed**: context-optimization, four-bucket-strategy, token-efficiency, end positions, Mentions the four-bucket strategy (Write, Select, Compress, Isolate), Recommends implementing compaction/summarization at 70-80% threshold, Suggests using sub-agents for context isolation, Addresses progressive disclosure or just-in-time loading, Mentions placing critical info at beginning/end positions (attention mechanics)
